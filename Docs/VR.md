# TODO

# For this release:

+ Track down the memory leak that seems to kill the process after a few minutes of streaming updates.

+ 2D window spanning multiple cells with custom geometry generation.
  (I kind of did this by letting the thing exceed its cell bounds)


+ Tuning system for InQueue variables, possibly via console commands.

# Shell

+ Add a gutter between cells (5%?) to fix rapid oscillation.
+ Fix edges not linking up exactly.
+ Bring text close enough to make it readable.
+ Custom wraparound geometry for 2D spanning multiple cells.
+ Context specific menus.

# VNC

+ SRGB encode color values

+ Separate tweaks for xCurve and yCurve.

+ client->appData.qualityLevel - runtime setting?

+ When app suspends, the texture input queue fills up and this (currently, thanks to Present semantics) deadlocks the app.  Detect this and stop sending updates, but accumulate a texture dirty rectangle.  When unsuspended, submit the entire dirty rectangle.

+ SRGB transform on the VNC thread.

# Performance

+ Bounds accumulation for Geometry objects, frustum culling
+ Optimize various decoders using NEON.
+ Accelerated CopyRect?
+ 16bit pixel support (runtime option)
+ Server-side scaling support?  Check to see if it actually works.
+ More profiling inside libvncserver (turbojpeg, rectangle copy, etc).

+ Memory tracking?  (CPU precise and GPU estimate)
  With memory tracking we could force certain operations (InQueue append) to stall until memory is available.  Would be hard to budget for the case of many VNC sessions though.

+ Test performance of double (vs triple) buffer.
  (This may require stddev profiling info over a long period of time, maybe just do a strict CSV dump mode, could even use a file)

# Files

Idea for file widget- drag a file into a cell, it's represented by a filename and MIME icon.  Context menu provides "open with" options.

# DLLs

+ Install d8 (command line v8) on a Mac:

+ About embedding native modules into JNI apps:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15719149/how-to-integrate-native-runtime-library-with-dlopen-on-ndk

    The best strategy on Android is to load all native libraries from Java, even if you choose which libraries to load, by some runtime rules. You can use dlsym(0, ...) then to access exported functions there.

    APK builder will pick up all .so files it finds in libs/armeabi-v7a and the installer will unpack them into /data/data/<your.package>/lib directory.

+ Guide to integrating V8, apparently this works on Android:

https://developers.google.com/v8/get_started

+ Allow binding swipe axes to different features, with keyboard control.
  For example swipe in could be "get closer to the image, in the direction I'm looking"

+ Multiple sessions (window manager)
+ What is Comfort Mode?

# Keyboard

+ Bind a "console" hotkey with an editor for arbitrary console commands.
+ Keyboard string input.
+ All keyboard extended characters.
+ Keyboard modifier keys (toggle down, hold down until next non-modifier key press).

# Image quality improvements

+ Temporal jitter + reprojection with point filtering
+ Render direct to screen with homemade distortion (loses timewarp unless I reimplement it)

# Lazy free

A lazy free system could be implemented such that if inactive textures aren't used for N frames they are discarded, and created again on demand.  When a new texture is created the current texture is copied into it (assuming there is a GL API for this like CopySubResource) and the bits in the update queue are made equal between them.  This would cut the memory usage for inactive windows greatly but with some GPU cost on the first frame they are updated again.

# Note about memory usage

1440*900 -> 2048x1024 = 8MB x3 = 24MB texture data

GPU specs seem to indicate it uses shared GDDR3, and there is 3GB in the phone.  10x triple buffered VNC widgets + framebuffer copy (owned by the thread and not padded) would be ~320MB, significant but not worth worrying about right now.

# Rendering to TimeWarp overlay plane

Dedicated “viewer” apps (e­book reader, picture viewers, remote monitor view, et cetera) that really do want to focus on peak quality should consider using the TimeWarp overlay plane to avoid the resolution compromise and double­resampling of distorting a separately rendered eye view. Using an sRGB framebuffer and source texture is important to avoid “edge crawling” effects in high contrast areas when sampling very close to optimal resolution.

# Connecting a bluetooth mouse / trackball

Using the Android Motion events:

    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html

Have to plumb this through from the Java code:

    // VRLib/src/com/oculusvr/vrlib/VrActivity.java:
    public static native void nativeKeyEvent(long appPtr, int keyNum, boolean down, int repeatCount );

    // VRLib/jni/App.cpp
    void Java_com_oculusvr_vrlib_VrActivity_nativeKeyEvent( JNIEnv *jni, jclass clazz,
            jlong appPtr, jint key, jboolean down, jint repeatCount )
    {
        AppLocal * local = ((AppLocal *)appPtr);
        // Suspend input until OneTimeInit() has finished to avoid overflowing the message queue on long loads.
        if ( local->OneTimeInitCalled )
        {
            local->GetMessageQueue().PostPrintf( "key %i %i %i", key, down, repeatCount );
        }
    }

    if ( MatchesHead( "key ", msg ) )
    {
        int key, down, repeatCount;
        sscanf( msg, "key %i %i %i", &key, &down, &repeatCount );
        KeyEvent( key, down, repeatCount );
        return; 
    }

# Throttling idea

Consider throttling on the VNC thread by not allowing it to contain more than N pixels (or MB?), instead of throttling on the render by not executing the entire queue.

This would be a form of cooperative throttling that might encourage the server to gather more updates together.
