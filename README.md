# Shellspace

This is the source code repository for Shellspace, my entry into the Oculus VR Jam 2015.

It's a prototypical VR desktop environment, starting with a VNC client and growing from there.

# Compiling

After getting the source code, add a section for your computer to `GearVR/bin/dev.sh`, setting various environment variables to the paths where your Android SDK parts are installed.

# Running

To run, connect your phone using `adb`, change directory to `GearVR/ShellspaceApp/` and type `./run.sh`.
